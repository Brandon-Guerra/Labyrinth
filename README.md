Labyrinth
=========

Maze game 
Labyrinth is a game where you must make your way out of a pitch black maze with only a small lantern to light the path.  The lantern burns oil which you can find hidden throughout the maze. Burn more oil to increase your field of view; but be careful, because once you run out oil you are trapped in the maze forever. 

Scenarios

Jimmy is a 12­year­old boy who longs for danger and adventure.  Jimmy would love to go outside and explore the woods behind his home, but because of his asthma Jimmy’s mom won’t let him be outside unsupervised.  All this means Jimmy usually comes home from school and plays video games.  He’s gotten tired of tetris and wants a taste of danger, so he plays Labyrinth for the thrill. 

Bernice is a 26 year old software tester who is too smart for her job, but lacks motivation to do more with her life.  Bernice usually finishes all the work she has for the day before 4:00pm, and has to fill her time with something for the last hour before she can go home.  Bernice used to spend a lot of time in the break room during that time, but Bernice’s boss is an incompetent dictator who only feels like he’s doing his job if he’s telling people what not to do.  Now Bernice finishes up her day by playing games in her cubicle.  Labyrinth is one of Bernice’s favorites because it is simple enough to be relaxing and difficult enough to be addicting. 

Non-Goals

Labyrinth will not include extra hazards or powerups, enemies, drivable vehicles, teleporters, or jetpacks.
